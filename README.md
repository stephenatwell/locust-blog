#Sample demo of using Locust.io with Armory CD-as-a-Service
This sample demonstrates how to use Locust.io from within Armory cd-as-a-service.

## Requirements
* This demo uses the account name 'demo-staging-cluster' to identify the Kubernetes cluster to which it deploys. Configure CD-as-a-Service using that name, and you will be able to deploy.
* If you are triggering via github actions you will need to setup a client credential in github that will be used to connect to CD-as-a-Service. See https://docs.armory.io/cd-as-a-service/setup/gh-action/ for more information.
